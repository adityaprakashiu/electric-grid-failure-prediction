Input:
Enter number of nodes (substations): 2
Enter name, load (MW), and max capacity (MW) for node 0: X 50 100
Enter name, load (MW), and max capacity (MW) for node 1: Y 60 120
Enter number of edges (transmission lines): 1
Enter edge 0: from node index, to node index, load (MW), capacity (MW): 0 1 50 40
Enter load increase percentage to simulate (e.g., 10 for 10%): 10

Output:
Grid Status:
Nodes (Substations):
Node X: Load = 50 MW, Max Capacity = 100 MW
Node Y: Load = 60 MW, Max Capacity = 120 MW
Edges (Transmission Lines):
Between X and Y: Load = 50 MW, Capacity = 40 MW

Initial Overloads Detected:
Overloaded Transmission Lines:
- Between X and Y
Grid is connected.

Simulating load increase by 10%
Overloaded Transmission Lines:
- Between X and Y
Grid remains connected.
