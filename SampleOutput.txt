Output:
Grid Status:
Nodes (Substations):
Node A: Load = 100 MW, Max Capacity = 200 MW
Node B: Load = 150 MW, Max Capacity = 200 MW
Node C: Load = 80 MW, Max Capacity = 120 MW
Node D: Load = 120 MW, Max Capacity = 150 MW
Edges (Transmission Lines):
Between A and B: Load = 140 MW, Capacity = 150 MW
Between A and D: Load = 80 MW, Capacity = 90 MW
Between B and C: Load = 90 MW, Capacity = 100 MW
Between B and D: Load = 100 MW, Capacity = 120 MW
Between C and D: Load = 110 MW, Capacity = 100 MW
